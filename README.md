Explaining things well makes me understand them better.

* Root Finding
  * Fixed-point iteration, Newton's method, and Secant method (1-D) [[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JoKerDii/Scientific-Computing/blob/main/root_finding/root-finding.ipynb)].
  * Fixed-point iteration, and Newton's method (Multivariate) [[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JoKerDii/Scientific-Computing/blob/main/root_finding/multivariate-root-finding.ipynb)].
* Optimality Conditions
  * Optimality conditions and no-constrain optimization [[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JoKerDii/Scientific-Computing/blob/main/optimality_conditions/optimality_conditions.ipynb)].

* Constrained optimization
  * Steepest descent and Newton's method [[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JoKerDii/Scientific-Computing/blob/main/optimality_conditions/steepest_descent_newton_method.ipynb)].
  * Quasi-Newton methods: BFGS [[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JoKerDii/Scientific-Computing/blob/main/optimality_conditions/quasi_newton_methods.ipynb)].
